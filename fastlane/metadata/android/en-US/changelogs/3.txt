⚠️ Important Update: Action Required

Please read this carefully to avoid data loss.

I have globally renamed the application package from `com.openapps.jotter` to `com.openappslabs.jotter`.

🛑 What this means for you
Because the package name has changed, your phone will treat this update as a completely new app. You cannot simply "update" the existing app over the top of the old one.

🛠 How to Switch to the New Version

Please follow these steps strictly in this order:

1.  BACKUP YOUR DATA (CRITICAL)
    Open your current (old) version of Jotter. Go to Settings > Backup/Export and save your data file to a safe place on your phone (like your Downloads folder).

2.  Uninstall the Old App
    Once you have confirmed your backup file is safe, uninstall the old "Jotter" app from your device.

3.  Install the New APK
    Download and install the latest APK from the assets below.

4.  Restore Your Data
    Open the new Jotter app. Go to Settings > Restore/Import and select the backup file you created in Step 1.

I apologize for this extra step. This change was necessary for the long-term stability of the project. Thank you for your support!
