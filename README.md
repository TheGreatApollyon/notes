## 🏗️ Architecture

This app follows the recommended Google architecture guide:
*   **UI Layer:** Composable functions observing `StateFlow` from ViewModels (utilizing `lifecycle-runtime-compose`).
*   **Domain/Data Layer:** Repositories mediating between the UI and local data sources (Room/DataStore).
*   **Single Activity:** Uses a single `MainActivity` with Compose Navigation to handle screens.
